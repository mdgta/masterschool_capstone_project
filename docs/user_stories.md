This app is intended as a menstrual period cycle, based on symptoms other than bleeding. This primarily includes, but is not limited to, transgender and non-binary people (regardless of assigned gender at birth), who may experience varying symtpoms but do not experience bleeding.

# MVP
As a user, I want to be able to:
- Register with just an E-mail and password (just for the purpose of authentication- even though this app is related to medical data, it's intended for personal use and there's no reason to add unnecessary personal information such as name, gender, etc.)
- Add daily symptoms that I'm experiencing from a list of common symptoms
- Add my own custom symtpoms
- Add custom comments for every day
- Add/edit past dates' inputs
- Set time zone for auto-selecting the current day correctly
- Have the data visualised in a graph with all the symtpoms across the entire month/*n*-months
- Be able to **PERMANENTLY** delete my account and any personal data

# Technologies
- Use **Redux**
- Don't forget to use responsive design for the frontend :p

# Possible expansions
- Encrypt **all** user data
- Be able to see when my next period will likely start and end
  - I'm not potting this in the MVP as there will almost certainly not be enough data for this feature, unless more people are interested and this 
- Being able to schedule a daily reminder for taking medicine(s) and mark them as done
